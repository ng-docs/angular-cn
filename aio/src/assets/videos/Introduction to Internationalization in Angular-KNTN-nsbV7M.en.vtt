MARK THOMPSON: Hm.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.580
I wish there was some way
for me to get my application

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.490
to display in the
language of my users.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.810
Oh wait, there is.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.920
You want to find out how?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.450
Well, you know what to do.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.338
Stick around.

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:16.691
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.970
Hey, friends.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm Mark from the
Angular team, and I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.160
am thrilled to be back with
another crisp new video.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.980
Together we'll learn
about internationalization

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.190
and Angular and
internationalize an application.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.350
This is going to be great.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.790
Let's go over some terms before
writing any code so that way

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.870
we're all on the same page.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.160
If you're already familiar
with internationalization,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.130
you can skip ahead
to the next chapter.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.050
When talking about
making your app

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.640
available in
different languages,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.310
you may hear the terms
internationalization

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.020
and localization.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.620
Although these terms are
related, they are not the same.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.580
Let me explain.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.170
Internationalization, or
often abbreviated as i18n,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.720
is the process of
preparing and designing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.660
your app to support its
use in different languages

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.790
and language dialects.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.100
This could include
enabling your application

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.140
to support rendering
in different languages

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
by separating the content
that will then be translated.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.500
Also, the preparation could
include updating your app

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.390
to support bidirectional text--

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.210
that is, left to right
or right to left.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.310
Once you prepare your
app, the next step

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.320
is to localize the application.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.140
Localization is the process
of building versions

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.960
of your project for
your different locales.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.390
Wait, so what's a locale?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.930
A locale identifies a region
where people speak a language

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.610
or language variant.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.650
For a given locale,
there's specific

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.670
formatting for measurements of
time, numbers, and currency.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.100
There's also
translations of names,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.420
including time zones,
languages, and countries.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.640
Check out the description
for more resources

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.160
and helpful links
containing information

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.470
about locale settings.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.730
Locals take the format of
language ID hyphen locale

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.070
extension-- for example, en-US
for English and the United

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.080
States or fr-CA for
French and Canada.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.240
Here are a few more
things to consider.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.600
The internationalization
process technically only

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.880
needs to happen
once, and then you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.460
can localize your application
to as many locales

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.480
as needed without changing
your application code.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.760
If you expand your
application, you'll

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.220
need to ensure that
those new pages have

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.380
been internationalized.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.950
Now, teams may perform
the localization process

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.470
multiple times to support
different locales.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.600
And depending on
the target language,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.580
it may be revealed
that the string

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.980
sizes from one of the
locales may disrupt the UI.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.980
This can happen with languages
like German, for example.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.690
So be sure to review your UI.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.410
All right, great.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.140
With language
covered, let's go over

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.240
what we'll do together today.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.570
We'll install our dependencies
to add support for localization

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.670
and internationalization.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.310
We'll internationalize
our application.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.240
Then we'll localize
our application.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.050
Now here's the application
that we're going to localize.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.420
It represents an order
confirmation page

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.490
in an e-Commerce app.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.430
All right, let's head
over to the code.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.130
First, let's get those
dependencies installed.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.880
We'll do that using the
Angular localize package.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.890
From the command
line in your project,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.330
type ng add @angular/localize.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.930
And when asked if we want
to proceed, reply yes.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.800
This package gives us the tools
to localize our application.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.960
While we're getting our
dependencies sorted,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.810
we'll also update angular.json.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.990
First, we'll specify which
locale we'll be supporting.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.810
In my example, I'm
going to use Spanish.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.450
Under projects,
our app name, I'm

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.390
going to add the i18n property.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.090
Next, I will specify
the source locale

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.600
property, which is our locale
used in the source code.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.519
So for this example,
it'll be en-US.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.060
Let's add another property
called locale and specify

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.550
which locales this
application will support

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.420
and where the translation
file will be stored.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.390
That will be
src/local/messages.es.xlf.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.970
We haven't created this file
yet, but that's coming up soon.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.200
Under architect, build, options,
let's add another localized

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.870
property and give it the
value of an array with es-PR

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.970
as the only element.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.070
This tells the
Angular which locale

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.880
to build when it's time to
localize the application.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.100
Also, please note that
adding this property

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.540
also allows us to preview a
specific locale within ngcert.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.640
We can't preview
multiple locales

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.330
at the same time with ngcert,
so adding multiple locales

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.630
to the array or setting
the property value to true

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.240
will lead to an error when
running our application

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.520
with the dev server.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.950
All right, our app
configuration is done.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.630
Great job.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.710
Up next, let's check out our
application and look for OTIs.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.880
That's Opportunities
To Internationalize.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.600
In our application, where
can we find some OTIs?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.210
This application features
quite a few strings that

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.630
could be internationalized--
your order is on its way,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.760
thank you for shopping
with us and your order

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.340
has been processed,
the table header's

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.510
item quantity, date and
amount, and finally,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.830
the total amount text.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.550
We can also internationalize
the currency

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.490
for total amount
and the date value.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.590
Is there anything else?

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.020
Now, this one can
be easy to miss.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.090
If you said images,
then I want you

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.770
to get that handle
right now because I

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.960
have something for you.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.740
High five from me to you.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.540
That's right.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.670
The images will
have alt text that

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.480
needs to be translated into
the language of our locale.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.540
Now that we know which
things to internationalize,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.450
let's go to the code again.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.540
In app.component.html,
let's start

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.970
by updating the text
parts of the application.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.830
We'll mark these as
content that will

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.750
be displayed in
the selected locale

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.660
by adding the i18n attribute.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.900
In our case, we'll use the
basic form of the attribute,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.735
but developers can add
more metadata details

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:48.850
like customized IDs and
context for translators too.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.340
Next, we'll use pipes
for the date and currency

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.750
marked for translation.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.510
The date pipe and
currency pipe both support

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.630
locale-specific
formatting by default.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.270
We'll take advantage
of the i18n attribute

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.080
to mark the Alt text attribute
of the image for translation.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.470
The alt attribute isn't
the only option here.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.370
We can mark other attributes
for translations too.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.300
Before we move on
to the next step,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.230
let's use dollar sign localize
to mark the page title

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.755
for translation in our component
class app.component.ts.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.960
And just like that,
we've internationalized

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.890
our application.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.180
Let's go!

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.650
Now for the good part.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.100
We're going to use the extract
i18n command with the Angular

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.740
CLI to extract all of
the elements that have

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.750
been marked for translation.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.100
In the command prompt, type
ngextract--i18n and then

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.490
specify where the translation
file should live with

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.960
the output path option.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.580
In this example, I'll add
source/locale, which matches

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.310
the location from angular.json.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.300
In the locale folder
we just created,

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.440
we now have our messages
file, which is great.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.230
But these messages are
in the original language.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.730
Here's what to do next.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.280
We're going to make a
copy of this file for each

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.540
of our supported locales.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.440
I'm going to make a copy of
this file named messages.es.xlf.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.810
This is using the locale ID that
we specified in angular.json.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.770
At this point, we pass the
local files to the translator

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.190
and then update our project
with the updated files.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.290
But for this example,
though, we're

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.490
going to add the
translations ourselves.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.309
So in messages.es.xlf,
we find that each message

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.770
from our project has a section.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.010
In that section, we find
the ID for the translation

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.780
and the original text
under the source element.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.230
Our next step is to add a
sibling element to the source

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.390
element called target.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.000
The target represents
the translated text

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.070
for this locale.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.020
Let's make those updates now.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.400
Here's the moment of truth.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.940
Time to view our
localized application.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.270
From the command line,
we'll run ng serve.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.650
Now check our app
in the browser,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.320
and there we have it-- a fully
internationalized and localized

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.380
application.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.110
So exciting.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.140
ng serve is just our
dev server, but we

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.620
can build localized versions
of our app with ngbuild

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.950
and pass the localized flag
to build all of our locales

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.950
or leave it off to build
the locale specified in the

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.560
build config in angular.json.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.430
I'm going to use a local
server to serve our build.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:43.430
Next, I'll go to localhost port
3000/es for a Spanish locale.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.290
And here we have it.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.630
We can also go to en-US for
the English locale and whatever

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.780
other locale you configured
for this example.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.540
Right now, we can see the
changes in our local server.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.090
When it's time to
deploy the application,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.110
we'll want to configure the
server, the base href, and more

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.200
to properly show the users
their preferred language.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.930
The Angular documentation
has some great information

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.390
on how to set these
up, and you can find

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.010
links in the description below.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.530
One final thing to note--

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.860
you may be wondering why we
need a version of our Web

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.990
App for each locale.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.630
Why not follow patterns
defined by other solutions?

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.390
Well, these are some
great questions.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.020
First thing to consider is
that the translation step

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.200
is done as a part of
the post-build process.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.680
So your build times aren't
impacted by the localization

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.400
step.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.740
Next, consider the
performance cost

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.970
of changing the language of
your application in real time.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.450
To be able to change the
language without reloading

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.550
the page, each
translation string

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.500
will create a new binding.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.220
But most of the time, users will
not be changing the language,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.040
so the values of these
bindings will remain the same.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.490
Then, when change
detection runs,

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.470
it'll have to check
all of the bindings

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.840
even if you haven't
changed anything.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.830
And additionally, each binding
is an extra instruction which

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.470
adds to the application bundle.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.420
To change the language
during runtime

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.390
requires shipping the
translation library, which

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.270
also increases your app size.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.360
Here's another consideration--
translation files

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.800
aren't tree shakable.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.750
Again, let me explain.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.330
An application can have
thousands of translations

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.550
strings for a given language.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.430
It's hard to know which
translations will be used

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.800
and which won't for
a selected language.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.950
Applying the
translations at runtimes

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.590
means that we load all of
the translation strings

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.310
even if they aren't used
in your application.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.340
Because Angular does
build time localization,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.680
we'll only include the strings
that are used in the app.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.550
Now, there's a cost to the
Angular solution as well.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.470
You'll have to refresh
the page in order

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.190
to see the translations whenever
your user chooses a new locale

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.260
that your application supports.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.020
Now, every approach
has its trade-offs.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.230
Angular's build time
i18n is optimized

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.150
for load and performance.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.640
We believe that users
don't change the locale

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.430
too frequently.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.680
So a page reload once is
a reasonable trade off.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.115
And friends, if you do need to
load your translations at run

00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:25.220
time, there is a way to do it
using dollar sign localize.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.170
But this will only work once.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.250
If you're interested, I'm going
to link to the docs down below.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.290
All right, friends,
that does it for me.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.270
This has been a
lot of fun, and I

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.430
hope that you've enjoyed
our time together today.
