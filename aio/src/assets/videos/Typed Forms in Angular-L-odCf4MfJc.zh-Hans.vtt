00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.310
DYLAN HUNN: Hello,
Angular community.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.520
My name is Dylan Hunn, and
I'm a software engineer

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.740
on the Angular framework team.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.420
Over the last
eight months, we've

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.430
been working on
improving Angular forms.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.070
And I'm incredibly excited to
share this new feature with you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.480
today.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.970
Typed forms are
part of Angular 14

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.100
and are ready today
for you to start

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.750
migrating your application.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.810
Before we jump into the details,
let's get some background

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.400
on reactive forms.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.680
This might already
be familiar to anyone

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.580
who builds or maintains
a forms application.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.380
Reactive forms are one way
to build forms in Angular.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.120
Compared with
template-driven forms,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.630
they provide a more explicit
data model and state management

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.930
using RxJS and Observables.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.150
They are not always
the right choice.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.030
Template-driven forms are
less verbose and better

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.010
for some use cases.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.200
These new types we're
going to see today

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.130
are only for reactive forms.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.450
So that's where we'll focus.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.960
Let's start with some background
on why we're making this change

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.600
and how it benefits
most applications that

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.620
use reactive forms.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.890
Typed forms have long been the
most upvoted feature request

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.820
from the Angular community.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.360
Additionally, this
change unlocks a number

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.480
of future improvements, such
as better control state change

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.240
events, stricter template
type checking, and much more.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.340
When designing typed
forms, we tried

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.350
to follow some North stars.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.900
In particular, we had
four guiding principles.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.650
First, we want the
types to be powerful.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.390
You should be able
to confidently

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.150
modify even the
most complex forms,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.360
no matter how deeply nested
you have form groups or form

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.820
controls.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.450
Second, we don't want to
completely replace forms.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.760
We want to have one
unified ecosystem

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.570
that we move forward together.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.930
Third, we want forms to
be as safe as possible, no

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.820
more surprising
anys in your types

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.650
when you access
values or controls.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.590
And fourth, you should be
able to gradually migrate

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.460
at your own pace, even if you
have a lot of existing forms

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.850
code in your application.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.970
Now let's consider an example.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.860
In general, every
form corresponds

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
to a schema, or the shape of
the data you want to collect.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.030
This is an example schema
representing a party.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.530
It has inner objects--

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.180
in this case, the
address field--

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.620
and inner arrays-- in this
case, the menu for the party.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.180
It's never necessary to
explicitly declare your schema,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.460
but it's always useful to
think about when you're

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.270
working with a complex form.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.180
By contrast, we do explicitly
declare the form model.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.280
And this is the corresponding
form for hosting a party.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.610
It accepts inputs for the
parties address, for the menu,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.380
and for any other form
controls you might want.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.440
Previously, interacting
with complicated forms

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.320
models like this one
could be hazardous.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.380
For example, this code
contains a subtle bug.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.100
The value of place is number
and calling a substring on it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.580
will crash at runtime.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.860
Now, with typed
forms, this bug will

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.720
be caught at compilation
time right in your editor.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.660
These new types
permeate the API.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.560
You'll benefit from them
when accessing form values,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.230
getting deeply nested
controls, subscribing

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.950
to Observables, and so much
more at virtually any point you

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.050
interact with the
forms API surface.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.260
This will give you
much improved safety,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.810
preventing both simple
typos and more complex bugs.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.320
The types also allow for
robust autocompletion right

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.110
in your editor.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.710
In the party form example, when
accessing the form's value,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.670
the IDE suggests every
known child of the form.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.430
This helps you navigate
even the most complex

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.680
forms with confidence.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.750
Although this is
a big change, it's

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.200
100% backwards compatible with
all of your existing forms

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.500
code.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.320
When you update to
Angular 14, your forms

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.680
will be automatically
opted out of the new types.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.380
Then, when you're
ready, you can turn them

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.200
on one control at a
time and incrementally

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.220
migrate at your own pace.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.350
Now that you've got
the basics, let's

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.750
explore the types in action.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.760
So a moment ago, we saw a
schema for building a party.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.340
Now let's have a look at some
actual code corresponding

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.570
to the form for this party.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.420
So let's jump into
the template and we'll

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.810
add a new button corresponding
to hosting a party.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.170
And we will call the partyInSF
convenience function.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.660
Now we'll jump into the
corresponding component

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.480
and we'll add the convenience
function for throwing a party.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.870
We will access this.party
from the enclosing component.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.020
This corresponds to the form
group for all the party's data.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.260
And we will call setValue
on this form group

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.690
in order to give it a new value.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.580
However, notice
that we've actually

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.650
forgotten the house number.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.890
TypeScript will warn us that
we are missing a key here

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.600
because it expects
when we call a set

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.610
value, all of the keys in
the group to be present.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.080
So let's go ahead and add it.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.850
And notice that as I type, the
new TypeScript types also power

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.390
autocompletion.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.360
However, I still
have an error here.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.240
The type system doesn't just
check for missing properties.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.120
It also just checks
for all of the names

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.620
and all of the
types in the object.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.030
So here in particular, whereas
I currently have a number key,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.840
I should have a house key.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.350
Another option would have been
to use patch value instead.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.900
This still protects us
against serious typing errors

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.990
but relaxes the constraint
that requires us to have

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.100
all of the keys present.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.250
In particular, we can just
have the straight key.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.270
Now let's consider another case.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.270
Let's say that a neighbor
made a noise complaint

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.280
and we want to figure out
which neighbor it was.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.050
So we can add a new method
on our component here

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.410
and we can use the get method.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.990
The get method accepts a
string and will automatically

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.510
tokenize each field
in the string,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.850
allowing us to access
inner controls.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.580
And notice that the type
is correctly computed.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.217
In this case, we actually
have an error again.

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:25.050
That's because we're
trying to do arithmetic

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.700
with a string key.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.380
And this error
tells us we should

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.740
be using the house key,
instead which is numeric.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.470
Now that you've observed
the new types up close,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.050
let's dive into the
nitty-gritty design details.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.440
So consider the form
group we saw a moment ago

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.120
for an address.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.130
What should be the type
of address.controls

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.970
in this example?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.410
And on the other
hand, what should

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.110
be the type of address.value?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.150
When working with
typed forms, it's

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.740
important to know
about the difference

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.780
between the types of values
versus the types of controls.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.950
As we saw earlier with
the party example,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.190
the value is the
shape of your data.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.300
Here, for instance, the
street field has type string.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.750
On the other hand, you
can also access controls.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.330
Here, the street field
is a form control, which

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.150
has a string inside of it.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.190
Typed forms use
control types heavily.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.520
Although you rarely need to
specify an explicit type,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.430
if you do, you should
always use the control type.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.570
Another interesting topic
is resetting controls.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.330
Let's consider the simplest
possible form, just

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.200
a single control.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.240
When we first
consider this control,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.230
we see it contains a string.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.130
So we might expect the type
to be form control of string.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.060
However, there's
a tricky detail.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.960
When you're working
with a form control,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.650
you can call reset at any time.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.410
And when that happens,
the control's value

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.480
will immediately reset to null.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.600
This means that you cannot
always assume the value

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.610
of a control is a string.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.940
In previous Angular versions,
this example would crash

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.940
at runtime because you cannot
call a substring on a null

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.760
value.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.060
Angular 14 now protects you
from these kinds of errors,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.940
because the type of the
dog control in this example

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.230
is string or null.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.520
Sometimes, though, that's not
actually the behavior you want.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.240
In fact, many existing
forms of applications

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.570
do not rely on the existing
nullability of the controls.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.289
In Angular 14, form controls
have a brand new option

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.320
called nonNullable.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.419
Instead of resetting
to null, the control

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.350
will reset to its initial value.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.600
As you might expect,
this also removes

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.110
null from the controls type.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.540
In this example, we've gotten
rid of the nulls entirely.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.070
And now calling substring
is totally safe.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.310
A related area involves
disabled controls and the effect

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.900
that they have on
a form's value.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.210
With Angular forms,
disabled controls

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.020
are not included in
the form's value.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.110
This is similar to how
native HTML forms behave when

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.540
their controls are disabled.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.650
However, this has an impact
on the type of your form.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.070
When you call dot value,
any key in the form group

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.840
might have been disabled.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.590
As a result, the type knows
that each key is optional.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.260
And when you use this
value, the type system

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.070
enforces you handle the
possibility that each key might

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.150
be undefined.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.360
In this example,
when using cat.value,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.120
all of the fields inside
the cat form group

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.240
are optional, because they
might have been disabled.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.520
That, however, is
not the only case

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.190
in which we might have
optional keys in our form.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.010
Sometimes you want to be
able to freely remove keys

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.460
from the form.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.140
For example, here we call
removeControl on the name name.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.320
With typed forms, we can
now explicitly specify

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.190
which keys are optional
versus which are required.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.270
This allows the type system to
enforce that we safely handle

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.490
controls that might be missing.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.160
For form groups that are
entirely dynamic, where

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.650
you want to add or
remove many controls,

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.560
we've also introduced
a brand new companion

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.310
type called FormRecord.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.160
The typing improvements
here are wide and deep,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.180
and there's so much more
to be excited about.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.080
You can read about them in depth
in the new typed forms guide

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.380
available today on
angular.io and linked down

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.070
below in the description.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.530
We are so excited
about Angular 14

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.360
and the future of typed forms.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.890
We hope that you're
as excited as we

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.350
are, both for this project and
for the future of the forms

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.120
package as a whole.
