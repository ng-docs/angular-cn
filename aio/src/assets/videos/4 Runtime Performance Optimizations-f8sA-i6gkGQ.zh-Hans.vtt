MINKO GECHEV: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.670
My name is Minko Gechev.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.490
I'm working on
Angular at Google.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.410
Over the years, I
have profiled hundreds

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.705
of Angular applications.

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:10.830
And I have noticed that
the majority of performance

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.902
challenges fit into a couple
of different patterns.

00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:16.860
Today, we're going to
look into these patterns,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.340
and we're going to learn
how to resolve them.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.350
In this video,
first, you'll learn

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.810
how to use Angular DevTools.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.670
After that, we'll
identify different

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.750
performance-regression patterns
and learn how to resolve them.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.360
For this purpose, we'll
use a simple prototype

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.450
of a typical
business application.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.290
At the very top of the
UI, we have a bar chart.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.480
Under the chart,
we have two lists

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.400
of employees from organizational
Sales and R&amp;D departments.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.740
Each employee has a
name and a numeric value

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.670
associated with them that goes
through a heavy computation.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.690
In each of these lists,
we can ask new employees.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.328
As you'll see in
the code, there is

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:02.620
the foundation for implementing
the lead functionality,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.230
as well.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.660
But for simplicity, it
is not part of the UI.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.990
Remember I mentioned that the
numeric value for each employee

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.090
goes through a
heavy computation?

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.330
I have mocked this computation
with the Fibonacci function

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.550
to keep things simple.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.570
Notice that we've implemented
a pretty inefficient version

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.080
of Fibonacci so that even
minor performance problems can

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.310
have significant visible impacts
in the examples we'll explore.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.020
Implement the entire application
with just two components--

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.530
EmployeeListComponent, which
contains the list of employees

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.140
for the corresponding
department and has

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.260
a text input for
entering new employees,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.820
and the AppComponent,
which renders two list

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.330
instances of the
EmployeeListComponent and a bar

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
chart at the top.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.190
Before we jump to
the patterns, let

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.740
us look at how we can
profile an application

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.150
by using Angular DevTools.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.970
Angular DevTools is a
Chrome DevTools extension

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.820
that you can install from
the Chrome Web Store.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.400
It allows you to preview the
structure of your application

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.260
in the Components explorer.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.290
For this video, we'll be
primarily using the Profiler.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.510
To start profiling
an application, click

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.950
on the Record button.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.440
As Angular performs change
detection in your app,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.740
you'll see bars corresponding to
the individual change detection

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.790
cycles appearing in
DevTools's timeline.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.980
When we select the
frame from the timeline,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.110
we can preview how
much time we spend

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.090
on the individual components.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.910
Here, we spend the majority of
the change-detection invocation

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.930
within the MatFormField
and EmployeeListComponent.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.180
DevTools allows us to
preview the Profiler output

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.470
in different formats--

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.640
bar charts, tree maps,
and flame graphs.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.070
The flame graph provides
a hierarchical view

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.840
of the component tree.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.980
When we click on a
particular component,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.520
we can see how much time
Angular spent on it.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.120
For example, we spent
about 0.1 milliseconds

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.820
on detecting changes within
the EmployeeListComponent.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.210
Since our application doesn't
have a complicated nested

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.990
structure, we'll use the
default bar chart view.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.360
Now let us look at
individual patterns.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.420
We'll describe the
cause of the problem.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.370
You'll learn how to
identify it and resolve it.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.390
The first pattern we're going
to look into is zone pollution.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.010
Let us go back to
the application

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.340
and start recording with
Angular DevTools's Profiler.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.460
If we start interacting with the
bar chart in the application,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.100
we'll see that we trigger
multiple change detection

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.000
cycles, each of which takes
a decent amount of time.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.680
If we explore the
change detection cycles,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.860
we'll see that the source
of the change detection

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.720
is mouseup and mousemove events.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.600
Each cycle takes more
than 740 milliseconds,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.160
which significantly drops
the browser's frame rate.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.700
We spent most of the
time in the two instances

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.030
of the EmployeeListComponent,
where each check takes

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.830
more than 360 milliseconds.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.320
Now let us resolve this problem.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.200
The beginning of
app.component's template

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.320
is div container where
we render the bar chart.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.860
We initialize the chart in
the Ng on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.080
lifecycle hook in
the app.component

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.430
by invoking the new plot method
of the Plotly charting library.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.250
We pass the ID of
the DOM container

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.370
and the data we want to render.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.640
Given the mouseup
and mousemove events

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.950
that we got in
the Profiler, this

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.350
means that probably the
initialization logic of Plotly

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.200
is adding these
EventListeners to the bars.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.180
Plotly offers a
standalone library

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.400
that doesn't need to
interact with Angular.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.370
We can run the initialization
logic outside of the Angular

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.940
zone to prevent the invocation
of redundant change detection

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.920
cycles.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.110
Let us go to the
constructor of app.component

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.380
and inject the Ng zone.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.050
We can go back to the
chart's initialization logic

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.540
and the rapid
inside of a callback

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.810
that we pass to
runOutsideangular.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.880
When we go back
to the application

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.740
and start the
Profiler, we'll see

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.410
that interactions with
the bars in the bar chart

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.890
don't trigger change
detections anymore.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.460
The zone-pollution pattern
occurs when the Angular zone

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.190
wraps callbacks that trigger
redundant change detection

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.750
cycles.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.260
Polluting the zone happens when
we run an initialization logic

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.560
that uses requestAnimationFrame,
setTimeout,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.810
or addEventListener.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.270
We can identify the
problem by looking

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.990
for unexpected change detection
cycles in the Profiler output.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.390
In most cases, I have
found that the reason

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.090
is requestAnimationFrame.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.050
The solution is usually
pretty straightforward.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.230
All you need to do is move
the initialization logic

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.870
outside of the Angular zone.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.990
The following pattern we'll
look into is the out of bounds

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.855
change detection.

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:09.230
Let us go back to
the application

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.640
and enter a new employee.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.210
Notice that the experience
is pretty laggy.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.540
When we start profiling, we
notice two change detection

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.920
cycles triggered on
each character we enter.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.290
The first one is
on the Input event,

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.900
and the second
one is on keydown.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.920
For both events, we spent
more than 380 milliseconds

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.140
detecting changes
in the two instances

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.380
of the EmployeeListComponent.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.910
Notice that even though
we are typing only

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.430
in the input for the
Sales department,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.670
we also check the
R&amp;D department.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.610
Since typing in
these input changes

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.370
only the View state within
the Sales department,

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.540
detecting changes in the
R&amp;D department is redundant.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.130
Let us fix this.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.700
For this purpose, we'll update
the change-detection strategy

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.270
of the EmployeeListComponents
to OnPush.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.060
With OnPush, Angular will
trigger change detection

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.640
within the component
when we pass input

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.960
with a new value based
on an [INAUDIBLE] check.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.180
We'll use an immutable
list from immutable.js

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.610
to prevent mutation of
the array references

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.160
and also, to ensure efficient
structure of sharing of data.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.630
Let us first change the Sales
and R&amp;D department arrays

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.400
to immutable lists.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.150
After that, we'll update
the signatures of the Add

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.540
and Remove methods
in the app.component

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.710
so that they can accept
immutable lists of employees.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.740
Next, we need to make sure we
assign the results produced

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.590
by these two methods to
update the local references

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.060
and pass them down the component
tree to EmployeeListComponent.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.520
We need the assignment
because we are no longer

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.890
mutating the lists.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.590
Instead, Immutabe.js
creates new ones.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.540
Since we're now
passing immutable lists

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.250
to the EmployeeListComponent,
we need

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.830
to update the type
of its data input.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.380
Immutable lists have size
rather than a length property,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.250
so we need to update the
property access in the template

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.570
and set the changeDetection
strategy to OnPush.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.192
Now, let us get back
to the application.

00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:19.650
Notice that entering
a new employee

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.860
now is a little faster,
even though it still

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.630
looks pretty laggy.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.860
Let us fix this.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.070
We'll do this as part of the
refactoring of out of bounds

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.450
change detection.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.220
When we start typing
into the input,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.640
Angular performs change
detection pretty regularly.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.830
It checks the whole
EmployeeListComponent

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.730
and evaluates each employee's
heavy computation twice--

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.200
on input and on keydown events,
even though none of the values

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.460
have changed.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.560
This happens because
typing into the input

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.950
triggers events that bypass
the OnPush change-detection

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.835
strategy.

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.520
And when an event within
a component with OnPush

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.080
change-detection
strategy occurs,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.600
Angular will detect this
component for changes,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.810
even if it hasn't
received new inputs.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.460
The problem here
is that we're only

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.990
changing the local
state of the input

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.800
but not updating the
individual employees, which

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.650
means that it is safe
to completely skip

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.050
change direction for them.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.890
To improve the
performance here, we'll

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.860
refactor the component tree.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.130
Currently, the app component
renders two instances

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.560
of the EmployeeListComponent.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.030
At the end of this section,
the EmployeeListComponent

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.400
will use the NameInputComponents
to get new employees' names

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.590
and ListComponent to render
the list of employees.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.840
We'll use OnPush
change-detection strategy

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.350
for the list component.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.570
So this way, events happening
in the sibling component,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.940
the NameInputComponent,
will not trigger

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.120
any redundant revaluations
for employees.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.910
Let us first go to the directory
of the EmployeeListComponent

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.880
and create the
name-input.component

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.790
and the list.component.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.030
As the next step, we can
extract the input field from

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.940
the employee-list.component
to the template

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.450
of the name-input.component.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.270
We can also move the
corresponding styles, the label

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:18.410
property, and the handleKey
method and copy the out output.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.145
Let us also remove the
OnInit lifecycle hook.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.810
We can use the
name-input.component within

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.730
the employee-list.component's
template,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.120
handling the app's
output as the next step.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.670
Now let us move the rest of the
mat-list part of the template

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.470
to the ListComponent.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.340
We should also carry
the calculate method

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.610
and remove the OnInit
lifecycle hook implementation

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.140
because we're
simply not using it.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.565
Next, let us move the
Fibonacci function.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.480
We can now move the data input.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.970
Finally, we can copy
the remove output.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.500
To ensure the UI
looks crisp, we can

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.320
move the styles associated
with the list visualization

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.420
to the styles of
the list component.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.740
Finally, we can set the
change-detection strategy

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.310
of the list.components
to OnPush.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.160
Let us use the list.component
in the employee-list.components

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.590
template, passing the
corresponding input

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.855
and handling the remove output.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.900
When you go back
to the application,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.630
notice that the
typing experience

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:29.130
is without any noticeable lag.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.380
To recap, this
performance problem

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.900
occurs when an action
that only impacts

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.150
the local state of a
particular component

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.850
triggers change detection
in unrelated parts

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.500
of the componentry.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.860
We can identify the problem
by inspecting the Profiler's

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.380
output and finding
the components that

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.340
are not supposed to be affected
by a particular interaction.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.830
To resolve the issue, we
can isolate the component

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.080
which triggers frequent
local state changes

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.410
and sets the components with
expensive change detection

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.260
checks to use OnPush.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.540
The third pattern
we're going to look at

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.810
is the recalculation of
referentially transparent

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.880
expressions.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.190
If we have an expression
in a template that

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.500
could be replaced
with its value when

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.780
its parameters don't
change, we call

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.610
it referentially transparent.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.120
This means that we don't
have to recalculate

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.640
the expressions between
change-detection cycles

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.310
unless their input change.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.810
Let us go back to
the application

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.370
and add an employee.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.980
Notice that we got a pretty
expensive change-station cycle

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.860
triggered by the keydown event.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.630
We dropped the
browser's frame rate

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.200
and Angular spent most of
its change detection cycles

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.370
within the list component.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.770
When we add a new employee
to the Sales list,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.240
we invoke the add methods
of the app component, which

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.130
creates an immutable list.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.070
The immutable list passes
the new immutable list

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.550
to the ListComponent,
triggering its change detection.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.760
Angular goes through
the individual employees

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.190
and recalculates
their numeric values,

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.540
even though they didn't change.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.360
Ideally, you would want to
calculate the value only

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.310
for a new employee.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.560
We can improve the
application's performance

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.290
here with a little
bit of refactoring.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.420
We can create a new
pipe called calculate.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.990
Let us import the pipe
decorator and sets

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.360
the pipe name to "calculate."

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.430
Here, we explicitly
said the pipe

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.160
to be pure for readability,
even though that's

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.580
the property's default value.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.790
As a next step, we can implement
the CalculatePipe class,

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.540
adding a transform method and
implementing the PipeTransform

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.350
interface.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.270
Now let us move the
Fibonacci implementation

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.550
and remove the redundant
calculate method

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.840
from the ListComponent.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.750
Let us add the CalculatePipe
to the declarations

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.595
in the employee-list.module.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.360
Finally, we need to update the
template of the ListComponent

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.270
to use the pipe rather
than a method call.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.040
Notice that now we
can add an employee

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.870
without any visible delays.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.250
To recap, this problem occurs
when Angular recalculates

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.650
the same template
expression repeatedly,

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:44.050
even though they depend only on
parameters that value does not

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.740
change.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.170
We can identify the problem
with Angular DevTools

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.540
by noticing change
detection cycles that

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.510
don't take time proportional to
the changes we made in the UI.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.750
The solution usually involves
either moving a calculation

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.600
to a pure pipe or caching
it via memorization.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.370
The final pattern
we're going to look at

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.700
is large component trees.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.920
Even if we have
optimized each component

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.440
and don't perform
redundant calculations,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.380
we can still observe frame
drops if we have thousands

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.780
of component instances.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.630
To show how we can improve the
performance in this scenario,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.990
I added a few hundred of
employees to each list.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.000
When we add a new
employee, we notice

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.700
that detecting the
ListComponent for changes

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.740
takes over 25 milliseconds,
which causes frame drops.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.140
Improving the performance
in large component trees

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.350
involves making the
component tree smaller.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.510
Standard techniques are
on-demand rendering,

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.020
such as virtualization
or pagination.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.280
For our purposes, we're going
to use the Angular cdk's

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.140
virtual scrolling component.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.120
In the template of
the ListComponent,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.910
we will use the
cdk_virtual_scroll_viewport

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.630
with item size equal to 50.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.109
And we're also going to add the
CSS class "viewport" so that we

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.780
can style this component.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.109
Instead of using ngFor
in the mat-list item,

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.599
we'll use the cdkVirtualFor.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.079
We'll also set the height of
the container to 800 pixels.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.240
And that's all.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.700
Now when we add a new
item, the change section

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.197
in the ListComponent
takes 1/5 of the time

00:17:27.197 --> 00:17:28.155
it used to take before.

00:17:33.433 --> 00:17:34.850
Keep in mind that
even if you have

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.270
highly optimized components
and render thousands of them,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.490
their templates
combined could still

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.220
be very expensive
during change detection.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.680
You can identify this
problem in your DevTools

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.380
if you find many
components that just

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.020
take a fraction of the
overall change detection cycle

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.070
or when there is one component
with a really large view that

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.590
takes a lot of
time to be checked.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.260
The solution involves on-demand
rendering of components

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.020
to trim the component tree.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.300
That's pretty much everything
I had for you today.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.310
We first went through
the fundamentals

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.330
of using Angular DevTools,
focusing on the profiler.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.130
After that, we
explored four patterns

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.530
that can help you
identify and resolve

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.170
common performance issues--

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.485
zone pollution, out of bounds,
change detection, recalculation

00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:23.990
of referentially
transparent expressions,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.410
and large component trees.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.460
Thank you very much for
watching this video.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.350
See you next time
and happy coding.
