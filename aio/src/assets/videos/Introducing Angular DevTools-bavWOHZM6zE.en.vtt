MINKO GECHEV: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.820
My name is Minko Gechev.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.440
I'm working on
Angular at Google.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.800
Today, in this video,
I'll want to show you

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.170
how you can use Angular
DevTools to preview

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.850
the structure of
your application

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.180
and profile its performance.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.760
Angular DevTools is a
Chrome DevTools extension

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.060
that you can download
from the Chrome Web Store.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.090
You can find a link in
the description below.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.220
When you install
Angular DevTools,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.250
you can go to
Extensions and pin it.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.950
The next step is to open
an application running

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.840
in development mode.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
See how the color of the icon
changed to red, indicating

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.570
we can debug the application.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.120
Now let us open Chrome DevTools
and find the Angular tab.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.160
Here we can preview
the component tree

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.990
of the application.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.150
Once we select the
component, we can

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.600
find its metadata,
properties, inputs,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.910
and outputs in the right panel.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.140
And we can modify them
directly from the UI.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.450
Now let us navigate
to the Profiler tab

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.450
and start recording
change detection events.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.250
We can preview change
detection cycles

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.800
as they occur in real-time.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.960
Each bar in the
timeline corresponds

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.450
to a separate change
detection cycle.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.400
We can find how much time
we spent in change detection

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.290
and whether the current
cycle caused any frame drops.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.350
We can also preview the
estimated frame rate and what

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.460
triggered change detection.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.620
At the bottom, we can
preview the components

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.110
we spent the most time in.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.620
When we select the bar,
we can see further details

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.080
for the particular component.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.930
To better understand the
application's execution,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.810
we can switch between the
default bar chart view

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.850
or the two alternative views--

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
flame graph and tree map.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.310
That is all I have
for you today.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
Head to angular.io/devtools
to find more advanced Angular

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.500
DevTools features.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.720
Thank you very much for
watching and happy coding.
